# Flower Classification 
The Flower Classification model is created using CNN. From importing the libraries to comparing the test and predicted value, the whole process is depicted. 
Image Data generator is used due to the lack of images in the datatset
ReduceLROnPlateau is used to attain more accuracy
The final accuracy was found out to be 82.2% but can be increased by playing with the hyperparameters.

Many photos in the dataset are rather unclear or taken at a distance.
